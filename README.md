This repo will give you a headstart on how you can make your own recommendation system using collaborative filtering

# What is a recommendation system/engine ?

![recommendation](https://github.com/Shaan5/Recommendation-Engine/blob/master/Recommendation%20Engine/Data/recommendation.jpg)

Recommender systems aim to predict users’ interests and recommend product items that quite likely are interesting for them. They are among the most powerful machine learning systems that is used by many OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5; Music platforms like Spotify, Saavn and many more. 

# Why companies need a recommendation system ?
Companies using recommender systems focus on increasing sales as a result of very personalized offers and an enhanced customer experience.

Recommendations typically speed up searches and make it easier for users to access content they’re interested in, and surprise them with offers they would have never searched for.

What is more, companies are able to gain and retain customers by sending out emails with links to new offers that meet the recipients’ interests, or suggestions of films and TV shows that suit their profiles.

The user starts to feel known and understood and is more likely to buy additional products or consume more content. By knowing what a user wants, the company gains competitive advantage and the threat of losing a customer to a competitor decreases.

# Types of Recommendation System
Typically there are 3 types of recommendation systems
1. Collaborative filtering systems
2. Content-based filtering systems
3. Hybrid filtering systems (Use of both 1 & 2 systems together)

Here I am going to demonstrate a sample on how you can make your own collaborative filtering based recommendation system

# Collaborative Filtering System

![collaborative](https://github.com/Shaan5/Recommendation-Engine/blob/master/Recommendation%20Engine/Data/collaborative.png)

In simple terms it can be said as for each user,recommender systems recommend items based on how similar users liked the item.

Collaborative Filtering is a technique which is widely used in recommendation systems and is rapidly advancing research area. The two most commonly used methods are memory-based and model-based. 

We are going to use MovieLens Dataset which has approximately 100k records of movies along with its different features to deal with.
For this purpose, first we are going to start seeing on how we can find similar movies which user like and then item based collaborative filtering system is built.

Code and data are provided in their respective folders.
